```

This format:

- Video file upload handling
- Provider detection logic
- Preview generation

- Poster/thumbnail display
- iframe generation for embeds
- HTML5 video element for direct URLs
- Keyboard accessible (Enter key support)

**Home.vue**
- Video content parsing
- VideoPlayer component integration
- Text filtering (removes video metadata)

#### Security Features
- ✅ URL validation before parsing
- ✅ JSON structure prevents code injection
- ✅ Lazy loading prevents auto-execution
- ✅ iframe sandbox attributes for security
- ✅ No eval() or dynamic code execution

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading
Videos use lazy loading to:
- Reduce initial page load time
- Save bandwidth for users
- Prevent auto-play issues
- Allow user control over data usage

### Upload Optimization
Video uploads through Blossom:

- Support large files
- Use existing authentication
- Maintain encryption standards

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (Desktop and iOS)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### Video Format Support
Depends on browser's HTML5 video support:
- **mp4**: All modern browsers
- **webm**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **ogg**: Firefox, Chrome

## API / Data Structure

### Friend Object with Group
```typescript
{
  pubkey: string;
  name: string;
  groups?: string[];  // New: array of group names
  group?: string;     // Legacy: single group (for backward compatibility)
  note?: string;
}
```

### Video Metadata Object
```typescript
{
  type: 'video';
  url: string;           // Original URL
  provider: string;      // 'YouTube' | 'Vimeo' | 'Direct' | 'Hosted' | 'External'
  embedUrl?: string;     // Embed/player URL
}
```

---

## Development Notes

### Constants
Video metadata format constants are defined for consistency:
```typescript
const VIDEO_METADATA_PREFIX = '[video:';
const VIDEO_METADATA_SUFFIX = ']';
```

### Regex Patterns
- Uses `match()` instead of `exec()` to avoid stateful behavior
- Global flag maintained for replacing all occurrences
- Tested with various URL formats

### Testing
- Manual testing with YouTube, Vimeo, direct URLs
- Browser compatibility verified
- Keyboard navigation tested
- Mobile responsiveness confirmed
